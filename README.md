### Overview

This AWS Cloudformation template will create AWS resources to monitor and send notifications if the burst credit balance of the specified Amazon EFS file system drops below predefined thresholds.

Throughput on Amazon EFS scales as a file system grows. Because file-based workloads are typically spiky—driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time—Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time. Amazon EFS uses a credit system to determine when file systems can burst. Each file system earns credits over time at a baseline rate that is determined by the size of the file system, and uses credits whenever it reads or writes data. The baseline rate is 50 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage). Accumulated burst credits give the file system permission to drive throughput above its baseline rate. When a file system has a positive burst credit balance, it can burst. The burst rate is 100 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 100 KiB/s per GiB of storage).

If a workload accessing a file system relies on the burst throughput for normal operations, running out of burst credits could negatively impact the workload so monitoring the file system's burst credit balance is essential. This AWS CloudFormation template will create two Amazon CloudWatch alarms that will send email notifications if the burst credit balance drops below two predefined thresholds, a 'Warning' threshold and a 'Critical' threshold.  These thresholds are based on the number of minutes it would take to completely use all burst credits if the file system was being driven at the highest throughput rate possible, the permitted throughput rate. You enter these minute variables as input parameters in the Cloudformation template. The 'Warning' threshold and has a default value of 180 minutes. This means that a CloudWatch alarm will send an email notification 180 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. The second alarm and notification is a 'Critical' notification and has a default value of 60 minutes. This alarm will send an email notification 60 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. Permitted throughput is dynamic, scaling up as the file systems grows and scaling down as the file system shrinks. Therefore a third and fourth alarm is create that monitors permitted throughput. If the permitted throughput increases or decreases by 10%, an email notification is sent and an Auto Scaling Group will launch an EC2 instance that dynamically resets the 'Warning' and 'Critical' thresholds based on the latest permitted throughput rate. This EC2 instance will auto terminate and a new instance will launch to reset the thresholds only when the permitted throughput rate increases or decreases by 10%.

### Prerequisites

You must have an existing Amazon EFS file system in the region where you launch the CloudFormation stack. You must also have an email address, an existing VPC, and at least one VPC subnet with Internet access (for AWS API calls).

### 2) Confirm SNS subscription

The email address entered as an input parameter will automatically be subscribed to the SNS topic and will receive an 'AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation' email. Click on the 'Confirm subscription' link in the email.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-us-east-1/tutorial/efs-burst-credit-balance-notifications-confirm-subscription.png.png)

### 3) Verify CloudWatch alarms have been created

Verify all four CloudWatch alarms have been created. See the AWS Resources section below for the alarm names.

### 4) Verify the EC2 instance terminates after a few minutes

The EC2 instance will automatically terminate once the script runs that calcualtes the burst credit balance thresholds.

## Parameters
 ___

 ___
### Stack name

The name of the AWS Cloudformation stack. This must be unique and its recommended that you append a short GUID suffix to keep each iteration of this stack unique. The stack name is used in the name of the SNS topic and CloudWatch alarms.

example: fs-26e6418e

### Burst Credit Balance 'Warning' Threshold (Minutes)

The number of minutes before the burst credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. This is when the 'Warning' email notification will be send. Default is 180 minutes (3 hours).

example: 180

### Burst Credit Balance 'Critical' Threshold (Minutes)

The number of minutes before the burst credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. This is when the 'Critical' email notification will be send. Default is 60 minutes (1 hour).

example: 60

### SNS Email Address

The email address that will receive the 'Warning' and 'Critical' notifications.

example: darrylo@amazon.com

### Instance Type

The EC2 instance type launched in an Auto Scaling group that runs a script to reset the burst credit balance alarm threshold values. Default is t2.nano.

### Auto Scaling Group & Launch Configuration

One auto scaling group and launch configuration to launch and EC2 instance that runs a script to calculate the burst credit balance thresholds.

The auto scaling group will have a maximum size of 1, a desired size of 1, and a minimum size of 0.

The launch configuration will launch instances with no EC2 key-pair and the security group created above. A script is dynamically generated in the /tmp directory. This script will run at boot-time and will calculate the burst credit balance thresholds.
